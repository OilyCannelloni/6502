# 6502
Experiments with a 6502-based breadboard computer

## Goal
The goal of this project is to build and program a simple LCD game or interface on a breadboard WITHOUT using a microcontroller.
I am using a 6502 processor as the heart of the computer.

## The repository
This repo contains all the assembly code I ran successfully on this machine.
